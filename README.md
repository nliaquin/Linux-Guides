# Linux-Guides
A set of guides assisting with the installation and configuration of free software meant for Linux. There are guides for particular flavours, distros, and software available, as well as general guides for things that work for most Linux distros.

### The Best Way to Utilize These Guides
My guides are all written in markdown, so grab your prefered markdown reader and follow along.

*Every guide will have the following at the top:*
1. A Title
2. Proprietaries/Requirements (meaning if this program is for a specific distro or requires another program to run)
3. A Difficulty Level

So if I've written a guide on installing a theme on Xfce, of course it's going to say
> Propriteries: Xfce4

And if I'm writing a guide on installing dwm, you'll see
> Difficulty: Moderately Difficult

My difficulty scale is pretty much the following:
- Easy
- Slightly Difficult
- Moderately Difficult
- Very Difficult

Most guides will likely be easy.
