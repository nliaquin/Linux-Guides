# Linux-Guides
A set of guides assisting with the installation and configuration of free software meant for Linux. There are guides for particular flavours, distros, and software available, as well as general guides for things that work for most Linux distros.

## The Best Way to Utilize These Guides
My guides are all written in markdown, so grab your prefered markdown reader and follow along. My favorite markdown reader is Retext. You can install Retext on Debian-based distros by typing into a terminal

> sudo apt install retext

and you can open one of the .md guide files by typing into a terminal

> retext 'file'.md
