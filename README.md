# Linux-Guides
A set of guides assisting with the installation and configuration of free software meant for Linux. There are guides for particular flavours, distros, and software available, as well as general guides for things that work for most Linux distros.

### The Best Way to Utilize These Guides
My guides are all written in markdown, so grab your prefered markdown reader and follow along. My favorite markdown reader is Retext. You can install Retext on Debian-based distros by typing into a terminal

> sudo apt install retext

and you can open one of the .md guide files by typing into a terminal

> retext 'file'.md

### Naming Standard
There is a naming standard to my guides that typically goes as follows:
> 'program'-'distro flavor'-'action'
Program is whatever the specific linux application it is we're going to be learning about. Distro Flavor is what targeted system this is for. This will often say debian, but that doesn't mean it will only be for Debian. It means that this guide will be for Debian-based distros like Ubuntu or Mint. Action is what I'm trying to cover as far as information goes for that program. This could say 'installation', or 'configuration'.

So if I decide to make a guide on how to install Wine on Ubuntu, the guide will be titled

> wine-debian-installation

or if I want to show you how to configure Wine on Mint, the guide would be titled

> wine-debian-configuration

This standard exists so that it's easier to parse these guides. If any files don't follow this standard, it's likely because the program in question has no specific ties any flavor of Linux, it's either a Unix program or comes standard with every distro.
