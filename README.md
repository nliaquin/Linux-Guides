# Linux-Guides
A set of guides assisting with the installation and configuration of free software meant for Linux. There are guides for particular flavours, distros, and software available, as well as general guides for things that work for most Linux distros.

## The Best Way to Utilize These Guides
My guides are all written in markdown, so grab your prefered markdown reader and follow along. My favorite markdown reader is Retext. You can install Retext on Debian-based distros by typing into a terminal

> sudo apt install retext

and you can open one of the .md guide files by typing into a terminal

> retext 'file'.md

## Guide Standards
Every guide will be named in such a way that it's clear what the subject of the guide is.
*program name*-*action*
or
*program name*-*dependency*-*action*

### What does this mean?
*program name* should clearly indicate which Linux program we're going to cover. The optional *dependency* means that we're going to be depending on some other program, or in some cases distro, in this guide. *action* will denote what we're doing with that program. So if I'm making a guide on how to configure dwm for LightDM, the guide would be titled **dwm-lightdm-configuration**. If I'm making a guide on how to install nVidia drivers for a GeForce GTX 960, the guide would be titled **nvidia-340-installation**

### Exceptions
Sometimes I'll write a guide that just isn't standard like the rest, so if that's the case, it'll just be titled whatever fits its content the best.
