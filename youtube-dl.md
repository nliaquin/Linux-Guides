# Youtube DL Installation and Usage
In this guide, I'm going to quickly show you how to install and use Youtube DL

### Installation
Debian-Based Distros:
> sudo apt install youtube-dl

RedHat-Based Distros:
> sudo yum install youtube-dl

Arch-Based Distros:
> sudo pacman -S youtube-dl

If your distro doesn't have a repository with youtube-dl available, this is because some maintainers have chosen to exclude it for one reason or another. This next method will work on any distro, or even Windows, so long as you have Python or Python3 installed:
> python -m pip install youtube_dl
